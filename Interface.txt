Interface

1. Inside the interface we can define variables by using static & Final keyword.cannot define the instance variable.
2. Instance method access inside the Instace method.
3. Inside interface we canot define constrcutor inside class.
4. In abstract class we can define the construtor, can define the instancce variable.

5 Purpose of constructor: Intialized the object.intialize the variable.
6.For Every abstract class there should be child class.
7.First line of constrcutor should be super.
8. Java cannot support multiple Inheritance- If class extending another class, it will not extend the object.
ex: class A extends Object  - -- mutli-level interitance.
{
}
class B extends A, Object
{
}

Calling the variable & Intializing
1. Inside the class having the 3 class with same variable method,using construtor calling the variable(this), creating the object and passing the value.
3. mutiple inheritance is not supported in class, it will support in inhterfaces,(bec there is no implementation in declaration).

4. How multiple inherutance will supports in java- it will overiden ,when creating an object for child class-it will understand - if there is no implementation, it will call the multiple inheritance

IMP-5. If any interface having single ONE abstract 
method declaration- it is called as function interface.

IMP- 6. Inside the interface if there are no method declaration - marker interface.
